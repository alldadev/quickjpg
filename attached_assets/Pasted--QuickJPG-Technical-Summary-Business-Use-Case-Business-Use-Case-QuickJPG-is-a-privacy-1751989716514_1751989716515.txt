  Current Issues & Progress

  ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

  1. GitHub Actions CI/CD: Resolved pnpm/npm conflicts and lockfile compatibility
  2. Asset serving: Removed problematic _redirects file causing all requests to return HTML
  3. Deployment pipeline: Successfully deploying to https://quickjpg.pages.dev
  4. Page loading: Website now loads (was completely blank before)

  üî¥ Current Critical Issue: CSS Generation Failure

  Problem: Tailwind CSS is not generating any CSS files, causing the page to display with default HTML styling (oversized
  elements, no design).

  Root Cause: Custom Tailwind color tokens (bg-primary, text-primary) are not being recognized by Tailwind CSS v4, preventing
  CSS compilation.

  Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class 'bg-primary'

  Current Status: Page loads but appears unstyled with oversized icons and elements.

  Technical Details:

  Build Output Issue:
  # Build succeeds but no CSS files generated
  dist/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-CkJh7Gzn.js  ‚úÖ (JavaScript loads)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-DY5nchU2.js  ‚úÖ (React loads)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [no CSS files]     ‚ùå (CSS missing)

  Tailwind Configuration Problem:
  // tailwind.config.js - Custom colors not recognized
  colors: {
    primary: '#FFB100',      // ‚ùå Not working
    'primary-hover': '#E69E00', // ‚ùå Not working
    // ... other custom colors
  }

  Component Usage:
  // Components using unrecognized classes
  <div className="bg-primary">  // ‚ùå Causes build failure
  <div className="text-primary"> // ‚ùå Causes build failure

  Attempted Solutions

  1. Replaced custom colors: Changed bg-primary to bg-yellow-500 but issue persists
  2. Inline styles: Added style={{backgroundColor: '#FFB100'}} for critical elements
  3. Tailwind v4 compatibility: Issue may be related to Tailwind v4 syntax changes

  Next Steps for Resolution

  Immediate Fixes Needed:

  1. Fix Tailwind CSS configuration for v4 compatibility
  2. Ensure CSS generation works properly
  3. Test color system with proper Tailwind classes

  Alternative Approaches:

  1. Downgrade to Tailwind v3 if v4 compatibility is too complex
  2. Use CSS variables instead of Tailwind custom colors
  3. Implement CSS-in-JS as fallback solution

  Verification Steps:

  1. Build should generate CSS files in dist/assets/
  2. Page should display with proper styling and colors
  3. Elements should be properly sized and responsive
  4. Brand colors (#FFB100) should display correctly

  Deployment Status

  - Domain: https://quickjpg.pages.dev/
  - Status: ‚úÖ Deployed and accessible
  - Functionality: ‚úÖ JavaScript loads, React mounts
  - Styling: ‚ùå No CSS, unstyled appearance
  - User Experience: ‚ùå Poor (oversized elements, no design)

  Business Impact

  - User Experience: Currently poor due to styling issues
  - Conversion Rate: Will be low until styling is fixed
  - SEO: Good (proper meta tags, structured data)
  - Performance: Good (fast loading, client-side processing)

  The primary blocker is the CSS generation issue. Once resolved, the application should provide the intended professional,
  Smallpdf-inspired user experience.
